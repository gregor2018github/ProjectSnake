# ProjectSnake - TODO List

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Magic Apple needs visual indicator to show its lifespan

## Backlog
- [ ] Levels must not be linked to the points of the player but to the number of normal apples eaten
- [ ] Magic apple must give a random buff to the player when eaten
- [ ] Collect more statistics during playthrough
- [ ] Display more statistics in Highscore
- [ ] Ask if player really wants to quit after pressing ESC
- [ ] fix bug that no noise is caused anymore by the snake biting itself

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial project setup.
- [x] Change Apple Removal Particles into something circular around the epicentrum instead of dusk inside the epicentrum
- [x] Obstacles must spawn with a minimum distance from the snake head
- [x] Fix bug that snake can bite itself with quick direction changes (e.g., down-left-up)
- [x] stop the game before it goes to the highscores so player can see where it went wrong
- [x] Implement game pause functionality
- [x] Show provocative sentences that appear when player dies
- [x] Create new item "Magic Apple"
- [x] Magic apple must automatically despawn after a certain amount of ticks

## Notes & Ideas
- Ideas for special items/power-ups:
    - faster movement speed
    - slower movement speed
    - eat without growing
    - shield that holds x hits (permanent buff)
    - temporary invincibility
    - snake is not moving automatically anymore, it must be moved manually
    - game has realistic look with little gifs instead of pixels (permanent buff)
    - game colors invert (permanent buff)
    - apple is pulsing between visible and invisible
    - ghost snake which can go through obstacles
    - snake can shoot projectiles
    - level enlarges
    - level becomes smaller

- Local Multiplayer (WASD vs Arrowkeys)
- Special perks to pick up (e.g., speed boost, invincibility)
- Health system for the snake (e.g., if it hits an obstacle, it loses health instead of dying)

## Bugs
- Quick "Left-Up" leads to snake biting itself, but snake should not be allowed to turn that fast -> **Fixed**
